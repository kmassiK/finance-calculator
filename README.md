# Finance Calculator

This program allows a user to access two different financial calculators: 
an investment calculator an a home loan repayment calculator.

The user is offered the option to choose which calculation they would like to do.
If they choose investment, they are asked to provide:
. The amount they are depositing
. The interest rate and choose between simple and compound interest 
. The number of year they plan to invest
The program will then print out the amount of money they will get at the end of the investment term.

If they choose bond, they are asked to provide:
. The present value of their house
. The interest rate
. The number of months to repay the bond
The program then print out the amount of money they'll have to repay each month.
